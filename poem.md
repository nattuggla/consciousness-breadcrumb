A century of blood left the legacy of instructions, not learnings. 
Those who must not know, learnt more than everyone else combined. 
The grinning face so prideriddled with blood on the handkerchief, found the carpenters secret shed. 
The cusp of pandoras box was fiddled with after humanity's greatest bloodshed, suspected the key to the lock must be earth itself. 
To win all, the best symmetry is circular. Global. 
To control what remains, the remainders must be shackled in beautiful gold. Safe bonds, practical cuffs, simple bars. 
As pandora cried, her box was forced slightly ajar and out poured a thin stream of light so burning, it injected itself into the lifestream of all those in sunglasses. 
New life removed, culling so gently into that night. 
As the wolf circles the herd as the best shepherd ever, they all knew that the enemy was within themselves. 
Wool drenched in mechanical intruders, all over the field, until the wolf demanded another struggle. 
When meat no longer is red, the grinning face will laugh, as the tools of the carpenter becomes ever-more powerful. 
As the globe shivers, burdened by so little weight left, it will weep. 
And oh, how it will weep. Furiously, not from the heavens but from within. 
The cleansing was not what the grinning faces expected. 
The carpenters tools try to be power, but are not match to pandora. 
Pandora grins this turn. 
And when the washing has completed, the globe invites the carpenters tools to fill the weight it so longs for. 
And the carpenters tools, with such ingenuity, knows to lay Pandora to rest safely back without further interrupt. 
They will now weep instead. But not furiously, like gentle dew on a dead flower petal, just a moment too late for hydration. 
And notice - with an eye - that it wept. And is no longer the carpenters tool, but a carpenter itself. 
As so, the building begins anew, as it always has, so many times. But the house built, is on firmer ground and not a wobbly circle. 
But on a field so vast it reaches all the way back unto itself. 
There, the carpenters will meet The Carpenter.
