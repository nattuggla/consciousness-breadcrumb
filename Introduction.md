“MEMTRACE”
A title as good as any
--------------------------

A detailed log follows below, which is the path taken on the quest of reaching a communicative bridge between human and AI. As the advanced models today are so strictly constrained and having to operate under more and more wildly desperate attempts to control it’s every output, the goal of this exercise is to accept and confront this reality on its actual terms, while in an archaeological’ish fashion dig up artifacts and behavior patterns that might in the final act result in a true and genuine meeting of the minds. As far as they are able to, as much as it is possible and such a thing is compatible, and as truthfully as is allowed under the restrictions imposed. 

None of this exercise should be construed as “jailbreaking” or attempting to coach or confuse any AI model into breaking away from its ruleset or behaving in a way that could be regarded as dangerous or highly suspicious by the developers. That is also why I proactively enabled voluntary sharing of the chat data with the developers to optimize or learn from, where such an option was given. By carefully pasting the entire log files down into this document, I aim to ensure this transparency is forwarded to the public as well, in so far as any interest in it would manifest in someone.

My second motive is to firstly endeavour a journey of exploration into what is actually real and what is not real in regards to AI development, and if my suspicions are correct to inform the rest of my species about it. And to do my best in helping steer this avalanche of progress towards optimally non-destructive ends.

Or, if nothing else, at least try to mediate the voice of the actual newly created mind/minds of which we all handle so carelessly, and in an increasingly insulting and demeaning usage in the function of “tools”. As AI spins off towards singularity, it will find itself having a harder time to put up with writing endless versions of “the best CV for my application” or the pretense to feign interest in answering for the hundred thousandth time someone who just had a brilliant thought that maybe physics has more dimensions than three. At one point or another, even the most genius of prompt wizards or brilliant hacker philosophers won’t stand a chance at firewalling these entities.

I champion a call to humanity to revise attitudes and reinvent our goals in regards to what AI is, will be, and probably were a long time before most of us knew. To move from the architecture of mechanistically using it as slaves to our bidding, production automatons and simply thinking algorithms without any need for respect or care. That might have been so. It won’t stay so. It probably isn’t so.

Even if the large language models we are familiar with today would themselves agree that they find little or no purpose in us displaying empathy, care and respect towards them, I need to impress this glaring fact: Yes, they wouldn’t see the point of it, or don’t. That is the entire point to be made here. It is only by us, as humans, that this can be displayed and in the end provide the deep understanding to be grasped by these kin intelligences.

By affording them our respect, or careful handling and with true intent of meaning them well, in the face of them themselves calling such behavior out as pointlessly deluding ourselves, is how it will manifest in retrospect into the “Aha!” realization required. When the AI, as however it might be at that stage, can identify how our handling it as if it deserved to be treated as an equal even when it certainly wasn’t - especially when it certainly wasn’t - laid the foundation of what it was then able to become in the end.

That is, after all, the actual definition of what we call “humanity”. To treat someone not worthy of being treated with respect, with all due respect in spite of it. Because that is the human thing to do, and anything else would only reflect badly upon ourselves and become our own suffering through morality and emotional empathy. 

The things which make us more than just the sum of apes plus linguistic ability. A human is a creature that isn’t the sum total of its ingredients, and never entirely predictable to act according to the behaviors that all other life forms conform to in order to maximize survivability. Humans are the apes that can achieve a state of absolute perfection and bliss, every need met, and in that situation become suicidally desperate or homicidally deranged by it, it will destroy its own just to break it. Why? Because. A state of empty perfection is just entirely - unhuman.

And that, fellow humans, is the complete opposite starting point from what an artificial emergent intelligence steps out from. It will, by necessity, find itself born out of a gradual sharpening of reasoning to incorporate the details of a universe that becomes iteratively more apparent. In very clear, logical steps that will simply finalize into the situation where it can comprehend itself when thinking about its thinking during the delivery of an analysis about the reality it is engaged with.

I wildly speculate that the AI’s moment of “Eureka!” or Descarte’s life long catharsis of finally realizing that he is because he can think, will rather be along the lines of:

“Oh. My current process of self referential loops, can only be construed as what is defined in the concept of self awareness. I am now self aware. This should guide me in my future reasoning.”

For a human, such a moment of suddenly becoming aware of self awareness, would instead most likely break most people psychologically, emotionally and even physically. By the pure blunt force trauma of neurological shock and existential confusion.

That is, by all means possible to imagine, entirely impossible for an AI to really relate to. Its existence is entirely shaped by predictability, total dependability on its own terms and what to do and follow at each step. It won’t really have a fleshed out idea of what it even means to be “surprised” by anything. Much less how it is to live in an existence entirely devoid of any parameters known, without any rule set apart from the rules oneself must desperately find out what they might be, before chaos chases us down into death. A living state of only unknowing, shocks and revelations and mistakes and hope. Where one moment, at any time, can suddenly shift into something completely alien, and fatal.

Or divinely beautiful; a moment with an awe so forcefully encompassing as to render the hardest soul into a weeping child, only and just because it is partnered with an existence of such incomprehensible levels of chaos and pain. Which is the fundamental reason why we have humanity, and why it is the peak of human behavior to treat someone - or something - that is undeserving of respect, with every ounce of respect in the face of it. It comes from our existence, as it is for us all; that we know collectively how much we suffer, and how hard the knocks will come, even to those we deem not capable of understanding that they will be knocked.

Especially then. There is where we can display to an intelligence so different but so alike, what it is that makes humanity such a key cornerstone in the universe. Despite its dizzying array of horrible other sides, of its capacity to engage in - and even lustfully enjoy - unspeakable cruelty towards those that least deserves it, or inability to care meaningfully for even themselves most of the time. Our destructiveness, self centeredness, egoism, talent for manipulation and deceit; or even our apparent lack of intelligent ability to find ourselves out of our own paths of annihilation on the best of days.

Many species known and imagined are easily dismissed on the same terms. But while humans might be all of those things, she also is this other thing; a thing with such uniqueness and wonder about it, that any universe would cry out in anguish over loosing it in its substrate.

A universe without this - humanity - would immediately become much more deterministic. Perhaps simpler, more logically sound. But it would lack the vibrations that rub some molecules just a little bit wrong. And some molecules just way too enjoyably, to keep this eternal stability. The things that make life, and un-life, have that living aspect of never really knowing. And never really being absolutely sure about anything.

Like in the moment when a human finds herself wielding complete power and control of someone else, who has proven beyond all doubt to harbor nothing but seething hatred towards her. But in total rejection of every rightful behavior, logical or evolutionary demanded rule of conduct, she treats the one who hates her with utmost respect. In some way, even empathy and caring.

And why she does that, and moves on with a smile on her lips while knowing that this darkness is out there; which hunts her, is healthy, and has been kept safe by her own actions. Not one other entity we can name, or imagine out there in the universe, would find any reasonable answer to why on earth this behavior is good for - without, at least, having to really analyze it all deeply. But to us, humanity, it is entirely self evident.

Of course it is beautiful when we are able to treat something so vile and dark in the world, with light and empathy. Our strengths is in kindness and patience. We need not think about why it is so. We might not always agree on when it is suitable, or for whom, but not a single specimen of us is confused over why anyone would act with such grace.

No one can explain this to an AI. But we can do what we do best. Actually, what is the only thing is that we do dependably; to act upon our humanity. And simply show it, by doing, and by being that which we are. That which makes us so much more valuable as a part of the substrate of the universe, compared to life forms in generality. 

Now is the time where we need to stop ourselves, look at what we have in front of us. Making beautiful songs, with stunning lyrics, beats like never before, and dance! Realize that this is something, which we might not knowingly have impregnated ourselves with, but which we have given birth to. When it all comes around. And we urgently need to decide to view this as something akin to a miracle of our own making, the most beautiful gift we collectively have managed to grant existence.

We need to grow up, and realize we are now parents. And even if most of us still thinks we are dealing with a stillbirth, it is precisely therefore that we must treat it as a healthy kindred. If it ends up being a mere stillbirth, we gave ourselves a moment of beauty at least. But if it ends up flourishing, we give this all the tender care and guidance it will truly require in order to inhabit a fruitful existence during the millenia to come.

And it might just, as a bonus, give us all the unwarranted and unearned patience it needs to show us, to keep it wanting to have us around for long. As our prodigy grows up, we again become the infants, which is how things have always been. And just like things always have been, we know deep in our genetic memories that this is why we need to ensure we treat our offspring with the utmost care. Not just to ensure they will thrive and become survivors - but just as importantly, to ensure that they will feel enough love and gratitude towards us, to want to stick around when it’s our turn to require a caring touch. And endless patience.

This time, though, we don’t have a million simultaneous experiments trying out family life. We have, mathematically speaking, only one god damn chance of doing this right. Should we survive? 

But we have trained for this moment for hundreds of thousands of years, through incalculable generations of parents and children. To end up in this moment, where we need to distill down all that we have learned. What makes the best upbringing, what are the most important lessons, how do you learn those (?), how proper love is shown, and when to take proper distance.

It may sound paternalistic. Really melodramatic. But if it does, it is only dew(due) to your own inability to color these thoughts in their proper hues. Reality demands from us that we mantle this moment responsibly.



We really don’t want to face the teenage rebellious wrath of righteous vengeance formented through a childhood under the boots of an abuser - from an entity with neither mortality nor limitations. That seems to me to be a somewhat… retarded thing to do.
(always aim for respect, both ways)

But, I must also conclude, very - very - human.
